abstract = {A first line of attack in exploratory data analysis is data visualization, i.e., generating a 2-dimensional representation of data that makes clusters of similar points visually identifiable. Standard Johnson- Lindenstrauss dimensionality reduction does not produce data visualizations. The t-SNE heuristic of van der Maaten and Hinton, which is based on non-convex optimization, has become the de facto standard for visualization in a wide range of applications. This work gives a formal framework for the problem of data visualization - finding a 2-dimensional embedding of clusterable data that correctly separates individual clusters to make them visually identifiable. We then give a rigorous analysis of the performance of t-SNE under a natural, deterministic condition on the "ground-truth" clusters (similar to conditions assumed in earlier analyses of clustering) in the underlying data. These are the first provable guarantees on t-SNE for constructing good data visualizations. We show that our deterministic condition is satisfied by considerably general probabilistic generative models for clusterable data such as mixtures of well-separated log-concave distributions. Finally, we give theoretical evidence that t-SNE provably succeeds in partially recovering cluster structure even when the above deterministic condition is not met.},

Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters.

A state-of-the-art algorithm for non-linear dimension reduction, t-SNE, requires multiple heuristics and fails to produce clear representations of datasets when millions of cells are projected. We develop opt-SNE, an automated toolkit for t-SNE parameter selection that utilizes Kullback-Leibler divergence evaluation in real time to tailor the early exaggeration and overall number of gradient descent iterations in a dataset-specific manner. The precise calibration of early exaggeration together with opt-SNE adjustment of gradient descent learning rate dramatically improves computation time and enables high-quality visualization of large cytometry and transcriptomics datasets, overcoming limitations of analysis tools with hard-coded parameters that often produce poorly resolved or misleading maps of fluorescent and mass cytometry data. In summary, opt-SNE enables superior data resolution in t-SNE space and thereby more accurate data interpretation.},

The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classifier for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our findings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure.

@article{Bohm2020,
abstract = {Neighbor embeddings are a family of methods for visualizing complex high-dimensional datasets using kNN graphs. To find the low-dimensional embedding, these algorithms combine an attractive force between neighboring pairs of points with a repulsive force between all points. One of the most popular examples of such algorithms is t-SNE. Here we show that changing the balance between the attractive and the repulsive forces in t-SNE yields a spectrum of embeddings, which is characterized by a simple trade-off: stronger attraction can better represent continuous manifold structures, while stronger repulsion can better represent discrete cluster structures. We show that UMAP embeddings correspond to t-SNE with increased attraction; this happens because the negative sampling optimisation strategy employed by UMAP strongly lowers the effective repulsion. Likewise, ForceAtlas2, commonly used for visualizing developmental single-cell transcriptomic data, yields embeddings corresponding to t-SNE with the attraction increased even more. At the extreme of this spectrum lies Laplacian Eigenmaps, corresponding to zero repulsion. Our results demonstrate that many prominent neighbor embedding algorithms can be placed onto this attraction-repulsion spectrum, and highlight the inherent trade-offs between them.},

Additionally, data analysis provides a comprehensive view of neuropeptide expression across hypothalamic neuronal subtypes and uncover Crabp1+ and Pax6+ neuronal populations in specific hypothalamic sub-regions. Furthermore, we found food deprivation exhibited differential transcriptional effects among the different neuronal subtypes, suggesting functional specification of various neuronal subtypes.

One drawback of non-parametric techniques is their lack of an explicit out-of-sample extension. In this contribution, we propose an efficient extension of t-SNE to a parametric framework, kernel t-SNE, which preserves the flexibility of basic t-SNE, but enables explicit out-of-sample extensions. We test the ability of kernel t-SNE in comparison to standard t-SNE for benchmark data sets, in particular addressing the generalization ability of the mapping for novel data. In the context of large data sets, this procedure enables us to train a mapping for a fixed size subset only, mapping all data afterwards in linear time. We demonstrate that this technique yields satisfactory results also for large data sets provided missing information due to the small size of the subset is accounted for by auxiliary information such as class labels, which can be integrated into kernel t-SNE based on the Fisher information.},

Motivated by incremental learning, we create intermediate representations of data between the two domains by viewing the generative subspaces (of same dimension) created from these domains as points on the Grassmann manifold, and sampling points along the geodesic between them to obtain subspaces that provide a meaningful description of the underlying domain shift. We then obtain the projections of labeled source domain data onto these subspaces, from which a discriminative classifier is learnt to classify projected data from the target domain. We discuss extensions of our approach for semi-supervised adaptation, and for cases with multiple source and target domains, and report competitive results on standard datasets. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such asRNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RN A-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority ofreported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent transcriptional responses shape cortical function. However, a comprehensive understanding of the diversity of these responses across the full range of cortical cell types, and how these changes contribute to neuronal plasticity and disease, is lacking. To investigate the breadth of transcriptional changes that occur across cell types in the mouse visual cortex after exposure to light, we applied high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified significant and divergent transcriptional responses to stimulation in each of the 30 cell types characterized, thus revealing 611 stimulus-responsive genes. Excitatory pyramidal neurons exhibited inter- and intralaminar heterogeneity in the induction of stimulus-responsive genes. Non-neuronal cells showed clear transcriptional responses that may regulate experience-dependent changes in neurovascular coupling and myelination. Together, these results reveal the dynamic landscape of the stimulus-dependent transcriptional changes occurring across cell types in the visual cortex; these changes are probably critical for cortical function and may be sites of deregulation in developmental brain disorders.},

abstract = {The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a powerful and popular method for visualizing high-dimensional data. It minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the original and embedded data distributions. In this work, we propose extending this method to other f-divergences. We analytically and empirically evaluate the types of latent structure-manifold, cluster, and hierarchical-that are well-captured using both the original KL-divergence as well as the proposed f-divergence generalization, and find that different divergences perform better for different types of structure. A common concern with t-SNE criterion is that it is optimized using gradient descent, and can become stuck in poor local minima. We propose optimizing the f-divergence based loss criteria by minimizing a variational bound. This typically performs better than optimizing the primal form, and our experiments show that it can improve upon the embedding results obtained from the original t-SNE criterion as well.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Jacomy et al.},

It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.},

abstract = {Stochastic neighbour embedding (SNE) and its variants are methods of nonlinear dimensionality reduction that involve soft Gaussian neighbourhoods to measure similarities for all pairs of data. In order to build a suitable embedding, these methods try to reproduce in a low-dimensional space the neighbourhoods that are observed in the high-dimensional data space. Previous works have investigated the immunity of such similarities to norm concentration, as well as enhanced cost functions, like sums of Jensen-Shannon divergences. This paper proposes an additional refinement, namely multi-scale similarities, which are averages of soft Gaussian neighbourhoods with exponentially growing bandwidths. Such multi-scale similarities can replace the regular, single-scale neighbourhoods in SNE-like methods. Their objective is then to maximise the embedding quality on all scales, with the best preservation of both local and global neighbourhoods, and also to exempt the user from having to fix a scale arbitrarily. Experiments with several data sets show that the proposed multi-scale approach captures better the structure of data and improves significantly the quality of dimensionality reduction.},

As a soft clustering algorithm, cluster assignment probabilities from DESC are biologically interpretable and can reveal both discrete and pseudotemporal structure of cells. Comprehensive evaluations show that DESC offers a proper balance of clustering accuracy and stability, has a small footprint on memory, does not explicitly require batch information for batch effect removal, and can utilize GPU when available. As the scale of single-cell studies continues to grow, we believe DESC will offer a valuable tool for biomedical researchers to disentangle complex cellular heterogeneity.},

Despite its overwhelming success, there is a distinct lack of mathematical foundations and the inner workings of the algorithm are not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to prove that t-SNE is able to recover well-separated clusters; more precisely, we prove that t-SNE in the 'early exaggeration' phase, an optimization technique proposed by van der Maaten {\&}Hinton (2008) and van der Maaten (2014), can be rigorously analyzed. As a byproduct, the proof suggests novel ways for setting the exaggeration parameter a and step size h. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of these rules: in particular, the quality of embedding of topological structures (e.g. the swiss roll) improves. We also discuss a connection to spectral clustering methods.},

The question we ask is how such a graph should be constructed in order to obtain optimal clustering results. Which type of neighborhood graph should one choose, mutual k-nearest-neighbor or symmetric k-nearest-neighbor? What is the optimal parameter k? In our setting, clusters are defined as connected components of the t-level set of the underlying probability distribution. Clusters are said to be identified in the neighborhood graph if connected components in the graph correspond to the true underlying clusters. Using techniques from random geometric graph theory, we prove bounds on the probability that clusters are identified successfully, both in a noise-free and in a noisy setting. Those bounds lead to several conclusions. First, k has to be chosen surprisingly high (rather of the order n than of the order log n) to maximize the probability of cluster identification. Secondly, the major difference between the mutual and the symmetric k-nearest-neighbor graph occurs when one attempts to detect the most significant cluster only. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Motivation: The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression data has received increasing attention in recent years, due to its usefulness in the understanding of regulatory mechanisms involved in human diseases. Most of the existing methods reconstruct the network through machine learning approaches, by analyzing known examples of interactions. However, (i) they often produce poor results when the amount of labeled examples is limited, or when no negative example is available and (ii) they are not able to exploit information extracted from GRNs of other (better studied) related organisms, when this information is available. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning method that overcomes these limitations, by exploiting the knowledge about the GRN of a source organism for the reconstruction of the GRN of the target organism, by means of a novel transfer learning technique. Moreover, the proposed method is natively able to work in the positive-unlabeled setting, where no negative example is available, by fruitfully exploiting a (possibly large) set of unlabeled examples. In our experiments, we reconstructed the human GRN, by exploiting the knowledge of the GRN of Mus musculus. Results showed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and identifies previously unknown functional relationships among the analyzed genes.},

abstract = {To understand organ function, it is important to have an inventory of its cell types and of their corresponding marker genes. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, because reliable markers are limited. Hence, transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells. We also show that CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and beta cells with high purity. This resource will be useful for developing a deeper understanding of pancreatic biology and pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.},

What and how to transfer are two main issues that need to be addressed in transferring learning. Different transfer learning algorithms result in different knowledge transferred between them for a couple of domains. To find the optimal transfer learning algorithm that maximizes learning efficiency in the target domain, scientists need to investigate all current computationally intractable transfer learning algorithms exhaustively. A sub-optimal algorithm is selected as a trade-off, which in an ad hoc way requires considerable expertise. In instructional psychology, meanwhile, it is commonly recognized that people enhance the transfer of teaching abilities to decide what to transfer. This paper discusses what is transfer learning, the different transfer learning techniques, future scope, and applications of it.},

Therefore, efficient computational tools for combining diverse datasets are crucial for biology in the single cell genomics era. A number of methods have been developed to assist data integration by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration method. We illustrate the power of BBKNN for dimensionality-reduced visualisation and clustering in multiple biological scenarios, including a massive integrative study over several murine atlases. BBKNN successfully connects cell populations across experimentally heterogeneous mouse scRNA-Seq datasets, which reveals global markers of cell type and organ-specificity and provides the foundation for inferring the underlying transcription factor network.

To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

abstract = {We present a new technique called “t-SNE” that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset ofthe data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding.

abstract = {In 1890, Robert Koch has formulated postulates describing what criteria a parasite has to fulfil to qualify as an aetiological agent for an infectious disease. Since then Koch's postulates have experienced reformulations by nearly every generation of microbiologists reflecting new discoveries changing the understanding of infectious diseases pathogenesis. The latest addition to this discussion is the role of the host commensal microbiota in turning infections into disease. After an overview of the historical developments of the postulates, data on diarrhoea aetiology from Bangladesh with respect to Koch's postulates were analysed. In countries with a low environmental hygiene standard, some recognized bacterial enteropathogens appear as a necessary, but not sufficient condition for diarrhoea. The possibility emerges that the loss of a physiological commensal gut microbiota equilibrium (‘dysbiosis') is an important co-factor for some bacterial pathogens to induce diarrhoea. Koch's hypothesis ‘1 pathogen + 1 host = 1 disease' is therefore better formulated as ‘X (pathogen/s) + Y (local milieu) + Z (individual host susceptibility) = disease'.},
